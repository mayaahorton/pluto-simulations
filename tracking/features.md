# Feature Tracking in Hydrodynamic Simulations

This directory includes scripts for tracking and plotting 3D features within simulated jets, such as:

* Changes to local sound speed
* Creation and divergence of terminal hotspots
* Descriptive jet length, axial ratio and curvature of jet path

More details TBD
